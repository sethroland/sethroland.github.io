            Hi, my name is Seth. I started a business (<a href="https://www.woodnotch.com">woodnotch.com</a>)
 with my brothers when I was 15 as a way to save money for our college education. Now I'm a senior in college about to graduate from Bob Jones University debt-free.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy rock climbing, riding horses, shooting guns, trick roping, metal casting, playing trombone, and traveling. I've traveled to China, Morocco, Mexico, France, and Israel and I would love to visit Dubai and KSA next.
